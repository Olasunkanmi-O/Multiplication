# Multiplication table
The objective of this project is to generate a multiplication table for a number entered by the user. the project made use of loops, handling user input, applying conditional logic and verifying validity of user input in Bash scripting.<br>
The project starts by requesting the user to input a number for which the multiplication table will be generated. Then, there is a choice of table range, whether the user wants a full multiplication table or a partial multiplication table. For the full table, it runs from 1 to 10 but for the partial, it prompts the user for the start and end of a range.
### The process
- Prompt the user to enter a number between 1 to 10

- If they want partial, ask for the start and end numbers of range

- If they want full, just generate the result for range 1 to 10.
